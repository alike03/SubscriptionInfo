Have you ever had the situation where you bought a game, only to later find out that it's already on Xbox Game Pass? It happened to me. Luckily it was only 10 bucks.
So I thought, "What if I could see that information directly on Steam?"
This addon runs the Steam ID of a game through the database I have created and displays if the game is currently on Xbox Game Pass or not.
